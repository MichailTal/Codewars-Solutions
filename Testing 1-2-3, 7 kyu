# Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with implementing the line numbering.

Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.

The numbering starts at 1. The format is n: string. Notice the colon and space in between.

def number(lines):
    lst = []
    count = 0
    for letter in lines:
        count += 1
        lst.append(str(count) + ": " + letter)
    print(lst)
    return lst
